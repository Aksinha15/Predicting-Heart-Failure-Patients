# Predicting Heart Failure Patient Mortality

This project aims to predict the mortality of heart failure patients using clinical records. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook and a dataset of clinical records.

## Contents

- **Predicting_Mortality_of_Heart_Failure_Patients_.ipynb**: A Jupyter Notebook containing the code and analysis for predicting patient mortality.
- **heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv**: A dataset containing clinical records of heart failure patients used for analysis.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Predicting_Mortality_of_Heart_Failure_Patients_.ipynb` to explore the analysis and predictions.
2. The dataset `heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv` is used within the notebook for predictions.

## Prerequisites

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Objective

The objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to predict the mortality of patients with heart failure, helping in better patient management and care.
